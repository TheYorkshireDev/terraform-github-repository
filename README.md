# terraform-github-repository

Terraform Module for managing GitHub [Repositories](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/) and associated resources.

**NOTE:** This module is going to be built iteratively and with defaults that follow my own preferences for a GitHub repository. With that in mind, it may not be feature rich at the moment but new features will be added as and when I need them. If you agree with my defaults and find the module useful, feel free to use and/or contribute to.
